Fantasy language generator
==========================

This project can be used to generate text for different fantasy
languages.

The project contains a Rossetta stone generator to generate the
same text in different language.

At the moment the following languages are supported:
- Italic (default input language)
- Dethek (Dwarven)
- Cirth
- Khuzdul (Derived from Cirth)

## Generating language

Grammar and word replacement is not considered while generating.
The letters are translated by replacing the characters with a language
specific font.

## Dethek

For Dethek some words will be replaced with an image instead of font
replacement when a Dethek symbol is available for the words as a whole.
