What is this file:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This ZIP archive contains the source file for Dan Smith's "Cirth Erebor" Help 
file for Windows.  It explains how these fonts can be used to write Elf, 
Dwarf and Human language inscriptions using the Cirth alphabet of Middle-earth 
with Windows applications.  (The Cirth alphabet was devised by J.R.R. Tolkien 
and sometimes used by natives of Middle-earth.)
